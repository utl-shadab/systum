                                    inquisitiveness with a non-sarcastic golf clap. The gist of this page is all about
                                    being of sound legal age (yup, over 21 in human years) and not mis-using the stuff
                                    you find on our little corner of the interwebosphere.</strong></p>
                            <p><strong>The following mumbo jumbo is the detailed legal-speak version. We recommend
                                    reading it in the voice of an olde-timey boxing announcer or even a monster-truck
                                    rally guy. This’ll ensure consciousness throughout. Cheers!</strong></p>

                                    and We hereby agree and consent that any claim, controversy, or dispute related to
                                    or arising out of access, browsing, downloading, or otherwise use to and of the

                                    offered by Lagunitas, whether based in contract, tort, statute, or other legal
                                    theory (<strong>“Disputes”</strong>), will be resolved by binding arbitration before
                                    a single arbitrator as described below. The arbitrator in a binding arbitration, and
                                    not any federal, state or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to
                                    resolve all disputes arising out of or relating to the interpretation,
                                    applicability, enforceability, or formation of this agreement, including, but not
                                    limited to, any claim that all or any part of this arbitration agreement is void or
                                    voidable. The arbitrator shall be empowered to grant whatever relief would be
                                    available in a court under the law or in equity. If you are a California resident,
                                    requests for public injunctive relief, if any, shall be decided by a court, not an
                                    arbitrator, and that request for public injunctive relief shall be severed from any
                                    arbitration proceeding and stayed pending a final determination of the
                                    arbitration.Nothing in this arbitration agreement shall be construed as a waiver of
                                    either Party’s right to seek public injunctive relief, and You and We agree to
                                    cooperate to effect the stay of any requests for public injunctive relief.
                                    Arbitration proceedings must be initiated within one (1) year after any Dispute
                                    arises; otherwise, the Dispute is permanently barred.
                                    <p>Any and all actions taken under this arbitration agreement are confidential and
                                        must not be disclosed to any third party. Any arbitral award will be final and

                                        appropriate to stop or prevent an imminent breach of these Terms, You and We may
                                        immediately resort to court proceedings in a court of competent jurisdiction in
                                        order to seek immediate injunctive relief without posting bond, proving damages,
                                        or meeting any similar requirement. Any Lagunitas institution of any such action
                                        for injunctive relief will not constitute a waiver of the right or obligation of
                                        Lagunitas to submit any claim seeking relief other than injunctive relief to
                                        arbitration.</p>
                                    <p>THE PARTIES UNDERSTAND THAT, ABSENT THIS MANDATORY PROVISION, THEY WOULD HAVE HAD

                                        RIGHT TO DISCOVER MAY BE MORE LIMITED IN ARBITRATION THAN IN COURT.</p>
                                    <p><u>Class Action and Class Arbitration Waiver:</u> You and We further agree that
                                        any arbitration shall be conducted in Our respective individual capacities only
                                        and not as a class action, and You and We each expressly waive Our respective
                                        right to file a class action or seek relief on a class basis. If any court or
                                        arbitrator determines that the class action waiver set forth in this paragraph
                                        is void or unenforceable for any reason or that an arbitration can proceed on a
                                        class basis, then the arbitration agreement set forth in this section above
                                        shall be deemed null and void in its entirety and the Parties shall be deemed to

                                    <p><u>Exception- Small Claims Court:</u> Notwithstanding the Parties’ agreement to
                                        resolve all disputes through arbitration, either Party may seek relief in a
                                        small claims court for disputes or claims within the scope of that court’s
                                        jurisdiction.</p>
                                    <p><u>Exclusive Venue for Litigation and Trial by Jury Waiver:</u> To the extent
                                        that the arbitration provisions set forth in this Section do not apply, the
                                        Parties agree that any litigation between them shall be filed exclusively in
                                        state or federal courts located in New York (except for small claims court
                                        actions, which may be brought where You reside). The Parties expressly consent
                                        to exclusive jurisdiction in New York for any litigation other than small claims
                                        court actions. In the event of litigation relating to these Terms or the
                                        Service(s), the Parties agree to waive, to the maximum extent permitted by law,
                                        any right to a jury trial, except where a jury trial waiver is not permissible
                                        under applicable law.</p>
                                    <p><u>Additional Terms:</u> This arbitration agreement is made pursuant to a

                                        Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. Sections 1-16.</p>
                                    <p>This arbitration agreement does not amend or modify any rights or obligations
                                        under any agency agreement, supplier agreement, vendor agreement, or any other
