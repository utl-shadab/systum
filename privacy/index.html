                            <p>The Services may have functionality that allows certain kinds of interactions between the
                                Services and third-party content, web sites, applications, platform, code ((e.g.,
                                plug-ins, application programming interfaces (“API”), and software development kits
                                (“SDKs”)), and Tracking Technologies (collectively, “<strong>Third-Party
                                    Services</strong>”). This Privacy Policy does not address, and We are not
                                responsible for, the privacy, information or other practices of any third parties,
                                including any Third-Party Services operating on or in connection with the Services, and
                                any third party operating any site or service to which the Services link. The inclusion
                                of a link on the Services does not imply endorsement of the linked site or service by Us
                                or by Our affiliates. You should consult the privacy policies of these Third-Party
                                Services to understand their practices.</p>
                            <p>For example, you may have an option to use your Facebook, Google or other account
                                provided by a Third-Party Service to interact with the Service, including by logging
                                into the service or posting information from the Service on the Third-Party Service (or
                                vice versa) ( “<strong>Social Features</strong>”). If We offer and you choose to use
                                Social Features, the Third-Party Service may send personal information about you to us.
                                If so, We will then treat it as personal information under this Privacy Policy since We
                                are collecting it as a result of your accessing of and interaction on Our Service. If
                                you use Social Features, and potentially other Third-Party Services, information you
                                post or provide access to may be publicly displayed on the Service (as described in the
                                User Content section above) or by the Third-Party Service that you use, depending on
                                your privacy settings on each. Similarly, if you post information on a Third-Party
                                Service that references the Service (e.g., by using a hashtag associated with Us in a
                                tweet or status update), your post may be used on or in connection with the Service or
                                otherwise by us. Also, both We and the third party may have access to certain
                                information about you and your use of the Service and any Third-Party Service.</p>
                            <p>Third-Party Services may use their own Tracking Technologies to independently, collect
                                information about you, including Third-Party Services to which you are directed from the
                                Service, including where you click a link and leave the Services entirely.</p>

                            <p><strong>Analytics:</strong> We use Google Analytics, which uses cookies and similar

                                will not be personalized. Nor will exercising these options prevent other companies from

                                not track” signals. We do not respond to those signals as there is not a consensus in
                                the industry as to what they mean.</p>

                                information, such as your email address, that you provide for such purposes, to
                                advertise to you. This may include making available your PI to certain third parties in
                                ways that may constitute a Sale and/or Sharing, as well as using your PI for purposes of
                                Targeted Advertising.</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Providing the Services</li>
                                <li>Contests and promotions</li>
                                <li>For purposes disclosed at the time you provide your information</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Processing purposes that may implicate Selling, Sharing, and/or Targeted Advertising
                                include the following:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li class="li1">Marketing and advertising</li>

                            <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Data Retention</span></p>
                            <p>Because there are so many different types of PI in certain categories, and so many
                                purposes and use cases for different data, we are unable to provide retention ranges
                                based on categories of PI in a way that would be meaningful and transparent to you.
                                Actual retention periods for all PI will depend upon how long we have a legitimate
                                purpose for the retention consistent with the collection purposes and applicable law.
                                For instance, we may maintain business records for so long as relevant to Our business
                                and may have a legal obligation to hold PI for so long as potentially relevant to
                                prospective or actual litigation or government investigation. We apply the same criteria
                                for determining if we have a legitimate purpose for retaining your PI that you ask Us to
                                delete. If you make a deletion request, we will conduct a review of your PI to confirm
                                if legitimate ongoing retention purposes exist, will limit the retention to such
                                purposes for so long as the purpose continues, and will respond to you with information
                                on any retention purposes on which we rely for not deleting your PI. For more
                                information on deletion requests see the Right to Delete section.</p>
                            <p><strong>Notice of Financial Incentive</strong></p>
                            <p>From time-to-time, we may offer you the opportunity to participate in sweepstakes,
                                contests, or other promotions (collectively “<strong>Promotion(s)</strong>” , which may
                                qualify as a “price or service difference” or “financial incentive” under California law
                                (collectively, “<strong>incentive programs</strong>&#8221; ). The categories of personal
                                information we collect and process in connection with your participation in the
                                Promotions include identifiers, contact information, personal records, commercial
                                information, Service usage information, and inferences.</p>
                            <p>You may opt-in to Promotions by signing up to them, typically through an online form we
                                provide. Because Promotions are typically not ongoing programs, you cannot opt-out of
                                Promotions once you have signed up (unlike a loyalty or points program that is ongoing,
                                where you can opt-out from ongoing participation). You can, however, exercise your
                                privacy rights by following the instructions below. If we provide any other incentive
                                programs that provide ongoing benefits or otherwise which you can opt-out of, we will
                                provide you with information on how to do so by updating this section or when you sign
                                up.</p>
                            <p>We are required to explain how incentive programs we offer are reasonably related to the
                                value that We receive from the personal information We collect in connection with the
                                incentive programs. In addition to administering the Promotions, we use and disclose the
                                personal information you provide for the other purposes described in Our privacy policy,
                                including marketing and advertising purposes. These activities generate revenue for Us
                                that We believe is reasonably related to the benefit you receive from participating in
                                the sweepstakes. We treat the value of your personal information that we collect in
                                connection with Promotions as equivalent to the potential increase in revenue
                                attributable to additional marketing customization value to the consumer due to the
                                enriched understanding, minus the program expenses associated with a Promotion. We
                                calculate that value by looking at the potential additional marketing customization
                                value to the consumer due to the enriched understanding of said consumer to determine
                                the average value of the data based on the attribute collected. For this reason,
                                Promotions are reasonably related to the value of the consumer’s data that we receive in
                                connection with Promotions.</p>

                                process such requests. For states that have passed consumer privacy laws but are not yet
                                in effect as of the Last Updated date, we will also consider applying state law rights
                                prior to the effective date of such laws but will do so in Our discretion.</p>
                            <p>Immediately below, we describe what privacy rights Consumers may have under the State

                                therefore, where required by law, provide you with the right to direct Us to limit Our

                                12-month period prior to the request date, related to categories of PI. You can request
                                that we disclose to you: (1) the categories of PI we collected about you; (2) the

                                collected about you. If you are a California resident, we reserve the right to provide
                                only PI collected on or after the CCPA’s lookback date, which is January 1, 2022. Please
                                note that PI is retained by Us for various time periods, so there may be certain
                                information that we have collected about you that since the lookback date, but that we
                                no longer retain; there also may be personal information collected 12 months prior to

                                effort to provide (and thus, it would not be able to be included in Our response to
                                you). Please also note that you may be limited to making two “right to know” requests in
                                any 12-month period depending on your state of residence.</p>

                                they apply). After we confirm that your deletion request is a Verifiable Consumer

                                following: (i) permanently erase your PI on Our existing systems with the exception of
                                archived or back-up systems, (ii) deidentify your PI, or (iii) aggregate your PI with
                                other information. In Our response to your request to delete, we will tell you the
                                method for deleting your PI. Where legal exceptions will apply to your request for
                                deletion, we will tell you which one(s) and will limit retention to the permitted
                                purpose(s).</p>

                            <p><em><strong>Do Not Sell/Share/Target</strong></em></p>
                            <p>Under the various State Privacy Laws, Consumers have the right to opt-out of certain
                                processing activities. California and certain other states have opt-outs specific to
                                Targeted Advertising activities, which involve the use of PI from different businesses
                                or services to target advertisements to you. California’s law refers to these activities
                                as “cross-context behavioral advertising” while other state laws refer to these
                                activities simply as Targeted Advertising. California provides Consumers the right to
                                opt-out of Sharing, which includes providing or making available PI to third parties for
                                such Targeted Advertising activities, while other states provide Consumers the right to
                                opt-out from processing PI for Targeted Advertising more broadly. There are broad and
                                differing concepts of the Sale of PI under the various U.S. State Privacy Laws, all of
                                which at a minimum require providing or otherwise making available PI to a third party.
                            </p>
                            <p>Third-Party Digital Businesses may associate Tracking Technologies on Our Services that
                                collect PI when you use or access the Services, or otherwise collect and process PI that
                                we make available about you, including some of the categories of PI in the table above.
                                Giving access to PI on Our Services, or otherwise, to Third-Party Digital Businesses
                                could be deemed a Sale and/or Sharing and could implicate Targeted Advertising under
                                some state laws. Therefore, we will treat such PI collected by Third-Party Digital
                                Businesses (e.g., cookie ID, IP address, and other online IDs and internet or other
                                electronic activity information) as such, and subject to the opt-out requests described
                                above. In some instances, the PI we make available about you is collected directly by
                                such Third-Party Digital Businesses using Tracking Technologies on Our Service or Our
                                advertisements that are served on third-party sites (which we refer to as “cookie PI”).
                                However, certain PI which we make available to Third Party Digital Businesses is
                                information that we have previously collected directly from you or otherwise about you,
                                such as your email address (which we refer to below as “non-cookie PI”).</p>
                            <p>When you opt-out pursuant to the instructions below, it will have the effect of opting
                                you out of Sale, Sharing, and Targeted Advertising, such that Our opt-out process is
                                intended to combine all these state opt-outs into a single opt-out. Instructions for

                            <p>Some of the State Privacy Laws require businesses to process Global Privacy Control (or
                                GPC) signals, which are referred to in some states as opt-out preference signals. GPC
                                signals are signals sent by a platform, technology, or mechanism, enabled by individuals
                                on their devices or browsers, that communicate the individual’s choice to opt-out of
                                Sale, Sharing and/or Targeted Advertising or limit the use and disclosure of their
                                Sensitive PI, such that the GPC signal effectively automatically communicates such
                                requests. To use GPC, you can download an internet browser or a plugin to use on your
                                current internet browser and follow the settings to enable GPC. To Our knowledge, we
                                have configured the settings of Our consent management platform to receive and process
                                GPC signals on Our websites, as explained by Our consent management platform <a

                                Please note that when we receive and process a GPC signal, we will apply such signal as

                                California law requires Us to state that we do not: (1) charge a fee for use of Our

                                described in the <strong>“Verifying Your Request” </strong>section below. We will not

                            <p>To make a request, please use one of the methods below. For additional instructions on
                                how to submit a Do Not Sell/Share/Target request as to Cookie PI, visit that section).

                            <p>Some information we maintain about Consumers that is technically considered PI may,
                                nonetheless, not be sufficiently associated with information that you provide when
                                making your request. For example, if you provide your name, email address, and phone
                                number when making a request, we may be unable to associate that with certain data
                                collected on the Service, such as clickstream data tied only to a pseudonymous browser
                                ID. Where we are unable to associate such information with the information you provide,
                                we do not include such information in response to those requests. If we cannot comply
                                with a request, we will explain the reasons in Our response. We will use PI provided in
                                a Verifiable Consumer Request only to verify your identity or authority to make the
                                request and to track and document request responses unless you also gave it to Us for
                                another purpose.</p>
                            <p>We will make commercially reasonable efforts to identify PI that we collect, process,
                                store, disclose, and otherwise use and to respond to your privacy requests. We will
                                typically not charge a fee to fully respond to your requests; provided, however, that we
                                may charge a reasonable fee, or refuse to act upon a request, if your request is
                                excessive, repetitive, unfounded, or overly burdensome. If we determine that the request
                                warrants a fee, or that we may refuse it, we will give you notice explaining why we made
                                that decision. You will be provided a cost estimate and the opportunity to accept such
                                fees before we will charge you for responding to your request.<br />

                            <p>When you make a request, we will verify that you are the person you say you are, or, if
                                you are seeking information on behalf of another person, that you are authorized to make
                                the request on their behalf (see Our “Authorizing an Agent” section immediately below).
                                In addition, we will compare the information you have provided to ensure that we
                                maintain personal information about you in Our systems. As an initial matter, we ask
                                that you provide Us with, at a minimum, your email address and phone number or email.
                                Depending on the nature of the request and whether we have the phone number or email
                                address you have provided in Our systems, we may request further information from you to
                                verify that you are, in fact, the Consumer making the request. We will review the
                                information provided as part of your request and may ask you to provide additional
                                information via email or other means to complete the verification process. We will not
                                fulfill your Right to Know (Categories), Right to Know (Specific Pieces), Right to
                                Delete, or Right to Correction request unless you have provided sufficient information
                                for Us to reasonably verify you are the Consumer that is the subject of the request. The
                                same verification process does not apply to opt-outs of Sale or Sharing, or limitation
                                of Sensitive PI requests, but we may apply fraud prevention measures (such as verifying
                                access to the email address or phone number provided when making the request).</p>
                            <p>The verification standards we are required to apply for each type of request vary. We
                                verify your categories requests and certain deletion and correction requests (e.g.,
                                those that are less sensitive in nature) to a reasonable degree of certainty, which may
                                include matching at least two data points provided by you with data points maintained by
                                us, which we have determined to be reliable for the purpose of verifying you. For
                                certain deletion and correction requests (such as those that relate to personal
                                information that is more sensitive in nature) and for specific pieces requests, we apply
                                a verification standard of reasonably high degree of certainty. This standard includes
                                matching at least three data points provided by you with data points maintained by us,
                                which we have determined to be reliable for the purpose of verifying you, and may
                                include obtaining a signed declaration from you, under penalty of perjury, that you are
                                the individual whose personal information is the subject of the request.</p>
                            <p>If we cannot verify you in respect of certain requests, such as if you do not provide the
                                requested information, we will still take certain action as required by certain State
                                Privacy Laws. For example, if you are a California Consumer:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>If we cannot verify your deletion request, we will refer you to this State Privacy
                                    Notice for a general description of Our data practices.</li>
                                <li>If we cannot verify your specific pieces request, we will treat it as a categories
                                    request.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p><strong><i>Authorizing an Agent</i></strong></p>
                            <p>You may designate an authorized agent to submit a request on your behalf using the
                                submission methods described above. If you are an authorized agent who would like to
                                make a request, the State Privacy Laws require that we ensure that a request made by an
                                agent is a Verifiable Consumer Request (except Do Not Sell/Share requests) and allows Us
                                to request further information to ensure that the Consumer has authorized the agent to
                                make the request on their behalf. Generally, we will request that an agent provide proof
                                that the Consumer gave the agent signed permission to submit the request, and, as
                                permitted under the State Privacy Laws, we also may require the Consumer to either
                                verify their own identity or directly confirm with Us that they provided the agent
                                permission to submit the request.</p>

                                have rights.<br />
